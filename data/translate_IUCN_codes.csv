1,presence,Extant,,"The species is known or thought very likely to occur currently in the area, which encompasses localities with current or recent (last 20-30 years) records where suitable habitat at appropriate altitudes remains (see note 2). Extant polygons can include inferred or spatially projected sites of present occurrence (see the Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria for further guidance). Extant ranges should be considered in the calculation of EOO. When mapping an “assisted colonisation” it is important to note that this range should be treated as Extant. "
2,presence,Probably Extant,,This code value has been discontinued for reasons of ambiguity. It may exist in the spatial data but will gradually be phased out.
3,presence,Possibly Extant,,"There is no record of the species in the area, but the species may possibly occur, based on the distribution of potentially suitable habitat at appropriate altitudes, although the area is beyond where the species is Extant (i.e., beyond the limits of known or likely records), and the degree of probability of the species occurring is lower (e.g., because the area is beyond a geographic barrier, or because the area represents a considerable extension beyond areas of known or probable occurrence). Identifying Possibly Extant areas is useful to flag up areas where the taxon should be searched for. Possibly Extant ranges should not be considered in the calculation of EOO."
4,presence,Possibly Extinct,,"The species was formerly known or thought very likely to occur in the area (post 1500 AD), but it is most likely now extirpated from the area because habitat loss and/or other threats are thought likely to have extirpated the species, and there have been no confirmed recent records despite searches. Possibly Extinct ranges should not be considered in the calculation of EOO."
5,presence,Extinct,extinct,"The species was formerly known or thought very likely to occur in the area (post 1500 AD), but it has been confirmed that the species no longer occurs because exhaustive searches have failed to produce recent records, and the intensity and timing of threats could plausibly have extirpated the taxon. Extinct ranges should not be considered in the calculation of EOO."
6,presence,Presence Uncertain,location_doubtful,"A record exists of the species' presence in the area, but this record requires verification or is rendered questionable owing to uncertainty over the identity or authenticity of the record, or the accuracy of the location. Presence Uncertain records should not be considered in the calculation of EOO."
1,origin,Native,,The species is/was native to the area
2,origin,Reintroduced,,The species is/was reintroduced through either direct or indirect human activity.
3,origin,Introduced,introduced,The species is/was introduced outside of its historical distribution range through either direct or indirect human activity
4,origin,Vagrant,,"The species is/was recorded once or sporadically, but it is known not to be native to the area."
5,origin,Origin Uncertain,,"The species’ provenance in an area is not known (it may be native, reintroduced or introduced)"
6,origin,Assisted Colonisation,,Species subject to intentional movement and release outside its native range to reduce the extinction risk of the taxon.
1,seasonality,Resident,,The species is/was known or thought very likely to be resident throughout the year.
2,seasonality,Breeding Season,,The species is/was known or thought very likely to occur regularly during the breeding season and to breed.
3,seasonality,Non-breeding Season ,,"The species is/was known or thought very likely to occur regularly during the non-breeding season. In the Eurasian and North American contexts, this encompasses ‘winter’."
4,seasonality,Passage,,The species is/was known or thought very likely to occur regularly during a relatively short period(s) of the year on migration between breeding and non-breeding ranges.
5,seasonality,Seasonal Occurrence Uncertain,,"The species is/was present, but it is not known if it is present during part or all of the year."
