WORK DONE

#udpated POWO search to trap when you have no results, ugly but works
#tweak map size to be same as left panel
#180 date line delt with for EOO, AOO not that useful
#Suggest Rating for EOO and AOO added
#Projection details stored for use later
#updated so that data progresses through to map
#updated so default fields are build etc as below
# a.	geocat_id = an internal ID which is populated on import (ie 1:nrow), new points will be added to this with a nrow + _leaflet_id (_leaflet_id is a unique number from leaflet) this should allow me to use this id to query all on map edits/delete. The reason for odd allocation is that leaflet assigns its own unique values and I can’t find a way to update (read only), there is a possibility of a clash if,  I just increment ID and I may have get back out the leaflet ID as some point (not sure I do). I may simplify this later.
#b.	geo_status = a record of what has happen to a point ie “new point”, “moved point”, “deleted point”
#c.	geocat_use = Flag to false it point is deleted (could query on above, but I feel this is quicker)?
#d.	geocat_analysis = Flag for any queries (ie GBIF only etc), which we can switch on or off depending on reactive # elements (ie your switches for GBIF/user)
# User editable, moveable, delete point etc
#download csv (ie the internal data)

WORK NEEDED
HIGH

# Analysis switch needs to be available once we have one point (maybe all the time, just return 00 for no points) or more in the above (I will look at this at some point). I think at the moment it switches on when csv is imported.
#error checks on CSV import only 
#check if you add a point outside of limits?? ie 189 with users add points
#at the moment I am using leaflet id for new points this may cause issues. I may need to check the max ID and add one to this? or maybe set as negative, this should work. Still a small chance over many edit sessions you will get a repeat!


MEDIUM
#report Projection
#report metadata (ie projection, GBIF query and citations etc)
# colour points by data_source
# TDWG maps from species name
# add new point comes with a map pin?
#sort out 180 probelm with coconut

LOW
# POWO search which returns nothing, need to inform user in the information box to the left (where steve reports missing values)
# POWO search clear off old searches (maybe a button)
# Map to reproduce over date line (ie not say map data not available)
# split aoo over dateline (not going to happen very often)
# allow data with long 180++
