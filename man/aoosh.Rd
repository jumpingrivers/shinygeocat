\title{Area of Occupancy (AOO), grid orgin 0,0}
\usage{
aoosh(thepoints, cellsize = 2000, returnV = "S")
}
\arguments{
\item{thepoints}{set of points in metres i.e. c(x,y)}

\item{cellsize}{size of cell (length) in metres}

\item{returnV, }{switches to return different sets of results: \cr
S = Simple, returns just the AOO area in km2, (DEFAULT) \cr
E = Expended simple, returns the solution for the AOO as list of (area,number of cells, rotation (0 degrees), shift in x direction(0), shift in y direction(0)). This is used so as be compatiable with other AOO calculations. \cr
SF = returns a polygon simple feature for mapping and plotting in ggplot/plot or export to GIS format.}
}
\value{
as returnV, default is area in km2
}
